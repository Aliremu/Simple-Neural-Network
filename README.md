# Simple Neural Network

A Simple Neural Network for... I don't really know the full extend to what this can do. I do know however that it can accurately predict and replicate any bitwise operator with more than 97% accuracy with only 5 seconds of training. Wow!!!!

Edit: it can approximate trig functions!!!??!? what wizardry is this.
